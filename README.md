Thanks for the opportunity to work on this task.
I have made effort to deliver the best possible outcome based on the provided requirements and my current knowledge and understanding of the website.

This test could probably use some improvments, but with the knowledge of testing environment and the website itself, this was the best I could do given the time frame.

In the step when adding last item to cart, I'm sure I could use some improvments, like asserting if acctually the last item is added, and if the last item is out of stock, etc. 
I have added those parts, but removed them afterwards -because I have faces a lot of synchronization issues - due to my computer performance, network issues, and page loading time. 
But I am willing to explain my approach.


If you have any questions regarding this task, please feel free to reach out to me.
