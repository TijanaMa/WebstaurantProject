Thanks for the opportunity to work on this task.
I have made effort to deliver the best possible outcome based on the provided requirements and my current knowledge and understanding of the website.

This test could probably use some improvments, but given the time constraints and my understanding of the testing environment and the website in question, it was the best I could do.

I'm sure I could use some improvements at the step -add the last item in cart, such as verifying whether the last item has actually been added and whether the last item is out of stock, etc. I first included those components, but I later deleted them because I experienced numerous synchronization problems as a result of my computer's speed, network problems, and page loading times. However, I'm happy to describe my strategy.

If you have any questions regarding this task, please feel free to reach out to me.
